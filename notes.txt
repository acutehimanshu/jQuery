DOM - Document Object Model:
whenver you load the page, browser put all the componenets in the data structure
that ds is called DOM. 

when dom is ready?
When all the data on the browser is loaded (Read complete html code)
--
$(function(){

});

$ is internally a pointer 
that is pointing toward a function type object 
we will pass to address of any function 
that will execute when dom will load. 
--

selectores
> means a > b -> b which is inside a will be selected
$('tbody > tr:even'): select even tr of tbody like 0 2 4 6
$('tr:nth-child(1)')  1st numenber tr will be selected // starts with 1, on 0th child its undesfined.
$('tr:eq(0)')  start with 0 (index based data selection)
$('td:contains(MAQ)) // case sensative // it means element that contain MAQ whose TR will be selected
$('*') selects everythings
$('h1:first') 1st h1 selected
$('h1:last')
$("[type]") - all elements tthat contains attribute type
$("[type='institute']") element contains attribute type with value institute
$("[type!='institute']") element Do not contains attribute type with value institute
$("p[type]") all element P which contains attribute TYPE will be selected.
$(":input") applied to all input (include buttons as well)
$(":button") application for only buttons 
:input, :button, :enabled, :disabled, :checked, :selected
$("p.good") that paragraph which class contains good will be selected
Methods
addClass
removeClass 

$('#placementView > tbody > tr:eq(0)').addClass('xyz').end().find("tr:eq(3)").addClass('pqr');
this is chaining 
when you hit end()  you get back again to parent. 

we are gatting Jquery wrappers here
how to get core data from javascript 
$('#placementView > tbody > tr:eq(0)').html(); from Jquery wrapper  
$('#placementView > tbody > tr:eq(0)').innerHTML; - ERROR 
$('#placementView > tbody > tr:eq(0)').get(0).innerHTML - CORRECT with get(0) we can get unwrapped data
or 
$('#placementView > tbody > tr:eq(0)')[0].innerHTML - CORRECT with get(0) we can get unwrapped data
.innerHTML .tagName


-----------------------
$(); // as soon as dom load it will work
vs 
window.addEventListern() ;; it will work when dom with its elements like css, js, images and so son will be loaded then it will work

$(#selector).on("AnyMethod", (ev)=>{
    alert($(this).html()); // ERROR
}) // if you are using Arrow function then you can not use This inside it. // means object ka address this me bind nhi hota he
this following won't work as this in arrow function does not get bounded with the object for which the event was designed to be fired. 
Soultion 
$(#selector).on("AnyMethod", function()=>{
    alert($(this).html()); // Working
})
but if you want to do it with arrow function then we have solution for it

$(#selector).on("AnyMethod", (ev)=>{
    //alert($(ev.currentTarget).html()); // ERROR
    alert($(ev.Target).html()); // ERROR
})
